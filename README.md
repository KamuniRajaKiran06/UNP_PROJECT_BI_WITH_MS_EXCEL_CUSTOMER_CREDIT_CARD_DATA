# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MS_EXCEL_CUSTOMER_CREDIT_CARD_DATA

My friends and I collaborated on the UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MS_EXCEL_CUST OMER_CREDIT_CARD_DATA project, where we undertook a comprehensive analysis of customer credit card data using Microsoft Excel. Our methodology included defining and tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess customer behavior related to spending and repayments. We utilized pivot tables extensively to dynamically structure and summarize the data, allowing us to uncover valuable business insights. Furthermore, we created pivot charts to effectively visualize patterns and outliers within the data. This project served as a practical demonstration of Excel's power in business intelligence for structured datasets and provided us with valuable experience in data analysis, visualization techniques, and teamwork.
